# Legacy Code Resurrection Project

This file is part of a glorious rescue mission: migrating ancient code from the dusty vaults of the internet to the shiny halls of GitHub.

This code has been preserved as faithfully as possible, warts and all. All code contained herein is original code written by Paul Nettle unless otherwise noted.

## Original description

FSRaid was once the #1 PAR tool on the net. It only supported the original PAR specification which has been superceeded by the PAR2 specification. You should track down one of the PAR2 tools instead of using this.

## Why preserve this?

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.

Happy coding!
